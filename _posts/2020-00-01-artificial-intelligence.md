Despite significant advancements in the field, there remain considerable number of high profile people who remain highly concerned about it. I, myself, am one of these.


The concern that i have, contrary to the popular belief of an AI takeover, is more immediate in nature. And that is the inexplicable nature of the AI program solutions. AI programs aren't written in the traditionally deterministic way, where a set of inputs almost always leads to the same output (give the their are no programming errors). AI programs are typically trained against labeled datasets. When exposed to enough labeled data points, the program can label an unlabeled datapoint based on its past training.  


But how does the program make that prediction exactly?  


Our inability to argue, reason and explain these programs' decisions can and will thwart any of our attempts to tame them if and when they make unexpected and unpredictable choices.  


The only saving grace, for now, is their continuing predictability for as long as it holds.
